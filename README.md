# LGHUB_Sync
Synchronize Logitech G Hub Settings across devices (PC/Laptop)

--------------------------------

Description:

I've been frustrated for a while with the fact that you can't have your Logitech G Hub settings saved to your user account on the cloud, I've lost some off my settings on my PC a couple times after making changes to the settings on my laptop and then moving the settings file over to my PC, the more changes I make the more frustrating it gets to keep it all in "sync", hence why I created this project, at least until Logitech adds the cloud functionally.

I've made a couple of scripts that I can run using the G keys on my Logitech Keyboard, however you can still run these scripts manually or automate them using the task scheduler, it's up to you. I prefer using the Macros for simplicity and I'm too lazy to create any automated task with the scheduler.

Disclaimer: 

This is the first project that I upload to Github publicly and I'm fairly knew to programming in Batch and Bash files, so please forgive any mistakes or bugs that you find. Hope this helps out at least someone else!

You're free to use this as you please as long as you don't charge for it and give proper credits!!! (Although I can't fathom anyone who would pay/charge for this, but just in case XD)
