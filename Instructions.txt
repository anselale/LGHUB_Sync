Requirements:

1.- Have Logitech G Hub installed.

2.- Have Google Drive installed. (This could be used with OneDrive or any other form of cloud drive that you can have direct access to from a terminal, but it would require modifying the Source and Destination paths in the scripts).

---------------------------------

Instructions for Windows (have not tired this on linux):

1.- You need to install a linux distribution in order to use the bash scrips in this project, instructions for this can be found online.

2.- Once you're able to run a linux bash shell in windows you'll need to install rsync, again instructions for this can be found online.

3.- Once you have rsync installed you need to copy the contents of the 'Local Disc C' folder to your Local Disk (C), the folder structure should look like this:

	- C:\Scripts\LGHUB
		- runSyncDownload.bat
		- runSyncUpload.bat

4.- You also need to copy the contents of the 'Google Drive' folder to your Google Drive folder (replace %USERNAME% with your username folder):

	- C:\Users\%USERNAME%\Google Drive\LGHUB
		- Backup
		- Logs
		- Scripts
			- SyncDownload.bash
			- SyncUpload.bash
		
(I'd actually like to place all scripts in a Google Drive folder, however in order to use these scrips with Macros I'd have to have 2 different scripts for each device I want to synchronize and it becomes tedious to maintain, so I can just have the same 2 scripts on both devices in the Local Disk C and I have no issues, I guess you could also make the scripts sync themselves but that's for a future version if I ever do one).

5.- Done!!! Once the files are in place all that's left to do is run 'runSyncUpload.bat' and 'runSyncDownload.bat' in 'C:\Scripts\LGHUB' to upload to google drive or download to your device respectively, you don't need to ever run the other 2 .bash files as the .bat files will call them. 

You can also set up some Macros or System Actions in Logitech G Hub if you have G-Keys on your Keyboard or Mouse, instructions on how to run applications with G Hub Macros and System Actions can be found online. Otherwise, you can just run them manually or create a scheduled task to run them automatically. 

P.S. The 'runSyncDownload.bat' script will automatically close and reopen the Logitech G Hub application, it needs to do this in order to update the settings file as it would otherwise be in use by the application and fail to sync.
